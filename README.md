## 📌 Brief description:
This project is a browser-based Quiz Application that allows users to test their knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions. The user is presented with one question at a time, with options to navigate forward or backward, select answers, and submit when complete. A countdown timer ensures timely completion of the quiz.

The goal is to deliver a smooth, interactive, and responsive quiz experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhanced with proper validation, score tracking, and user feedback.
